# Quick Pres: JS Standard Libraries (and some problems)

This was a very chill week with the interns giving some presentations on what they did, and just a very small presentation on an issue that the JS ecosystem has faced: a small standard library, and what happens when things go wrong. You can take a peek at [the presentation's slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vZdwNmZPQ9WwhEFCjSWjvF9Nx3U_s5pzTOEVJ_dFdBQ/edit?usp=sharing), but they're not very comprehensive.
