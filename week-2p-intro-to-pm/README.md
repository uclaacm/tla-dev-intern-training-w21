# Week 2 (PM) - Intro to PM

For this week, we had a wonderful guest join us and talk to us about what PM actually is!

Rucha is the current (2020-2021) president of ACM at UCLA, and a seasoned PM - she's worked at Facebook and Salesforce, and is returning to Salesforce full-time as a PM after graduation! In this video, she deconstructs what PM *actually is* - there are three different types - what PMs do, tips about PMing, and specific asks on how to start and improve as a student PM!

There aren't written notes for this workshop; however, you can:
