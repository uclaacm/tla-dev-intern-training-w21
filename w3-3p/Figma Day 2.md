## Day 2

Welcome back to Designing with Figma! I hope you've learned something from the last workshop and are ready to dig deeper into web design.

### Design ethics

There are many considerations when we think about [ethical design](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/ethics/). Here, I've listed two of the most important, although really it'd be best to take an ethics course to get a fuller picture (no pun intended).

#### Inclusion

What kind of people are you representing in your designs? What roles are you giving to your characters? Think about aspects of identity such as gender, ethnicity, body type, age, and ability status. Try to be aware of whether you are perpetuating stereotypes about what certain people can or should do. Inclusivity is ultimately a complex topic, and educating ourselves on it takes a long time. 

A rule of thumb I see a lot is that we should not tell stories that aren't ours to tell&mdash;but we can and should support others who are telling their stories, and include a cast of characters in our art that reflects our audience. Be open to listening and learning from members of communities that you want to portray.

Below is a beautiful graphic from [Microsoft's accessibility guides](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) illustrating how accessible design helps serve not only disabled populations, but also people who need extra support because of situations like loud airports or bars. Thinking about accessibility goes a long way in improving the product experience.

![Inclusive Design Table](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/3tRKmL2AfYAc4ysUQSiGAg/d44f450ea7660ac7ef132e2e90a2c38f/Inclusive_Design_Table.png?&w=736)

When in doubt, consider respectfully reaching out to organizations who offer their services for diversity consultation, and compensate them for their time. 

And if you're a struggling college student, start with free guides like those by [@commandurr](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBYU37fFzmP/) (one of my favorite web comic artists), [Kat Tsai](https://chuwenjie.tumblr.com/post/158694460814) of Steven Universe, [Jessi Eoin](https://medium.com/@jbeoin/how-to-draw-disabled-people-53cc48434532), or [@Phobos-Romulus](https://www.deviantart.com/phobos-romulus/art/Female-Body-Types-Tutorial-468154376). You can still support artists for free by following, liking, and reposting their stuff:)

Inclusivity isn't a question of "political correctness": plenty of quantitative research shows that seemingly surface-level images have real-life impacts on people, especially growing children who are learning about who they can be in this world. The goal is **inclusion**, not **tokenism**. Check out [further reading]() at the end of this article for some academic papers.

### A note on trendy trends

What do you think about hamburger menus (the three lines that indicate a menu, often found on apps)? What about GIFs, or icons? 

Designers (including me) often get caught up in what looks cool and forget to consider what's usable. Hamburger menus have been shown to unnecessarily hide useful information. Too-fast GIFs can be triggering to users prone to seizures.

And did you know that few icons are truly universal? Other than expressions such as :smile:, icons can be difficult for international, elderly, and other populations to understand, especially those who are not as familiar with what many assume to be a shared code.

Trends exist for a reason&mdash;they're quite good in some circumstances. Hamburger menus are great for tiny phone screens. Icons are nice for illustrating menu items and other options, but the best route is to label most icons redundantly with text. 

We will cover much more on the conflict between trends and accessibility in week 6, but try to keep in mind how your designs may have unintentional consequences.

#### Plagiarism

When you use someone else's work as inspiration, are you plagiarizing? 

Many cases of plagiarism are unintentional. However, it is often malicious. There are a ton of examples on the internet of up-and-coming artists' work getting stolen.

One of the most famous examples is the work of Barbara Kruger. 

![Work by Barbara Kruger and Roberto Barni in Italy, white text on red background.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Senza_titolo_%28Barbara_Kruger%29_e_Vacina_%28Roberto_Barn%29.jpg/800px-Senza_titolo_%28Barbara_Kruger%29_e_Vacina_%28Roberto_Barn%29.jpg)

Look familiar? [Read her statement](https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/i-think-about-when-barbara-kruger-dragged-supreme-a-lot.html) on a lawsuit that Supreme filed against a third party for copyright infringement.

The line between inspiration and plagiarism can seem fuzzy, but in general: if you are profiting off of work that someone could reasonably mistake for the work of a different artist, you are seriously plagiarizing.



## Further reading

As you know, things on the web are never permanent. To keep up with the trends, I recommend just staying aware of changes that are happening around you. Why did Google change their icons again? What does the new iPhone look like? 

The Community tab on your Figma home page is a great place to find neat things that the community is creating. You can also find inspiration from artists working in other media on Instagram, Pinterest, and more.

[Keyboard shortcuts](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040328653-Speed-up-your-workflow-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts)

Click the question mark at the bottom right hand corner of your workspace and click Keyboard Shortcuts for a full list. These are the ones that I use every day.

## Author's Note

Do you remember the elements of art and principles of design from elementary school? They're a pretty useful framework to make sure you are hitting all the right notes in a design. Click on each principle/element to see which Figma concept relates to it.

#### The Principles of Design

**Pattern**: Figma [components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma).

**Contrast**: accessibility & color contrast.

**Emphasis**: hierarchy.

**Balance**: constraints & positioning. frames & [presets](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041539473-Frames-in-Figma#Create_frames)?

**Proportion/Scale**

**Harmony**: we need to make our piece visually coherent & consistent. One way we can do this is by using [libraries and assets](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Get-started-with-Team-Library). Libraries are mainly for paid accounts, but 

Relevant shortcuts: `Alt` + drag

**Rhythm/Motion**: animations, videos, & [prototyping](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma)

#### The Elements of Art

**Line**: line options, rounding.

**Shape**: [boolean groups](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957534-Boolean-Operations)

**Form**: gradients.

**Color**: color theory, coming up with palettes.

**Texture**: effects and blending modes.

**Space**: importance of white space

**Value**:
